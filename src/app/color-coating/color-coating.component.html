    Color coating involves applying a uniform layer of color to an object or surface. 
    This coating serves both aesthetic and protective purposes, helping to prevent scratches, rust, or fading. 
    It's commonly seen in industrial products, home d√©cor items, and kitchenware. 
    Various finishes such as matte, glossy, or metallic can be achieved through this technique.
