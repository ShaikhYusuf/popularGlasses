    Frosting is a finishing technique primarily used on glass surfaces. 
    This process creates a matte or translucent effect, giving the glass a cloudy or frosted appearance. 
    It's commonly used for decorative glass items, perfume bottles, and wine glasses to add branding or design. 
    Frosting not only enhances the visual appeal but also gives the product a premium look.
