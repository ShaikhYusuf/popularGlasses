    Hot foil stamping is a decorative printing technique where metallic foil is applied to a surface using heat and pressure. 
    This results in a shiny, eye-catching effect that is often used on premium products like invitation cards, 
    cosmetic packaging, and luxury items. Gold, silver, and holographic foils are popular choices, adding a sophisticated and classy touch to the design.
