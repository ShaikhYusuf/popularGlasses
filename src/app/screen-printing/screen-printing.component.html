    Screen printing is a printing technique where a fine mesh screen is used to transfer ink onto a surface. 
    In this process, a stencil (or screen) is created that leaves only the desired design area open. 
    Ink is then spread over the screen, and a squeegee is used to press the ink through the mesh, printing the design onto the surface. 
    This method is widely used on fabrics, glass, plastic, and metal due to its ability to produce vibrant colors and detailed designs.
